    So, you found me! Hello and welcome!

    I'm glad to know that you are interested with my little work here.

    I'm not a front-end developer so you will definitely find below a lot of code used inefficiently. I just wanted to
    make this page a little more neater and nicer and I'm happy to learn more if you have an advice.

    Also I want to say thank you to Alex Wendland for the article (https://blog.alexwendland.com/2015/particle-network-js-animations/)
    that helped me to set up the animated background without becoming an expert in JS. I really appreciate people who
    share their results and let others learn on their experience - these are great people doing a great work.
    So if you meet Alex, remember to say hello and thank you from me.
